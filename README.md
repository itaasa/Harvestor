# Harvestor

This will be a web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user will enter the following data about their annual yield:
1. Crop Type
2. Unit for crops (kg or tons)
3. Price per unit
4. Monthy Wage Expenses
5. Monthly Tool Expenses
6. Monthly Utilities Expenses

The application will then display through graphs (chart.js) the values entered from the user input. The graph will also showcase points of profit/loss, how much more crop would be needed to make up for loses etc. The application will also display the total profit made for the year.
