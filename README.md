# Harvestor

This will be a web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user will enter the following data about their annual yield:
1. Crop Type
2. Unit for crops (kg or tons)
3. Price per unit
4. Monthy Wage Expenses
5. Monthly Tool Expenses
6. Monthly Utilities Expenses

The application will then display through graphs (Chart.js) the values entered from the user input. The graph will also showcase points of profit/loss. Also yearly totals for revenue, expenses, profits after input has been read. The graphs were made to be dynamic, so if the user decides to change data values, the graphs will be updated as well.
